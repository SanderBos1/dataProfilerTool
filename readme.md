# Profiler Insight

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, understanding the exact location and quality of your stored data is essential. 
Profiler Insight is designed to give you a competitive edge by providing detailed assessments of data quality and composition through its profiling capabilities.

Currently, Profiler Insight supports CSV files. 
I am  actively working on expanding its compatibility to include a broader range of files & database types in the future.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Docker**

   - **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).

2. **Install Docker Compose**

   - **Windows/Mac**: Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose. Simply download and install Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

3. **Download the Docker Compose File**
